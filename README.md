# JWT

To help prepare for API authentication tomorrow, research [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io) (known as JWTs). This should take about 30 minutes. You should be able to answer the following questions:

1. What are the 3 parts of a JWT?
2. What information does each part contain?
3. Why do people use JWTs for authentication? A great resource to read would be https://jwt.io/introduction/.
